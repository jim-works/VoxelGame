# VoxelGame

Technologies used: **C#, Unity**

Old Minecraft clone I made. It has proceudral generation, infinite worlds, breaking/placing blocks, somewhat of an item system, multiplayer, multithreading.

It also uses greedy meshing with a texture atlas, and it has its own AABB physics system (so no need to generate a unity collision mesh).

There's some stuff I forgot, but I made this project over a year ago. It was not planned very well and my coding abilities were not that great, so the project is pretty disorganized.
